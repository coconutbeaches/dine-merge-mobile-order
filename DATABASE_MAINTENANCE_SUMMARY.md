# Database House-Keeping & Maintenance Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the database maintenance tasks completed for the `orders` table to ensure optimal performance and handle growth.

## Files Created

1. **`maintenance_tasks.sql`** - Main maintenance script to run in Supabase SQL editor
2. **`partition_orders_table.sql`** - Partitioning script (use only if > 10M rows)
3. **`DATABASE_MAINTENANCE_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary document

## Tasks Completed

### 1. VACUUM ANALYZE
- ✅ Script includes `VACUUM ANALYZE public.orders` to reclaim space and update statistics
- ✅ Additional `VACUUM ANALYZE` after all changes are applied

### 2. Autovacuum Settings
- ✅ Configured aggressive autovacuum settings for growing table:
  - `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold = 1000`
  - `autovacuum_analyze_threshold = 1000`
  - `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.1`
  - `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.05`
- ✅ Includes queries to monitor autovacuum statistics and performance

### 3. Partitioning Consideration
- ✅ Script checks row count and provides partitioning recommendation
- ✅ Separate partitioning script provided for tables > 10M rows
- ✅ Monthly partitioning strategy implemented (partitioned by `created_at`)
- ✅ Automatic partition creation function included

### 4. NOT NULL + Default Values
- ✅ Analysis of NULL values in key columns
- ✅ Data cleanup before adding constraints
- ✅ Added NOT NULL constraints and defaults for:
  - `id` (NOT NULL)
  - `total_amount` (NOT NULL DEFAULT 0)
  - `created_at` (NOT NULL DEFAULT now())
  - `updated_at` (NOT NULL DEFAULT now())
  - `order_status` (NOT NULL DEFAULT 'new')
  - `order_items` (NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb)
- ✅ Note: `user_id` remains nullable for guest orders

## Additional Optimizations

### Indexes Added
- `idx_orders_user_id` - For user-based queries
- `idx_orders_created_at_desc` - For date-based ordering
- `idx_orders_updated_at` - For update tracking
- `idx_orders_status_created_at` - Composite index for status and date filtering

### Monitoring & Analysis
- Table size and bloat analysis
- Monthly distribution analysis for partitioning decisions
- NULL value analysis before constraint application
- Autovacuum performance monitoring

## How to Execute

### For Regular Maintenance (< 10M rows):
1. Open Supabase SQL editor
2. Run the contents of `maintenance_tasks.sql`
3. Review the output and recommendations

### For Large Tables (> 10M rows):
1. First run `maintenance_tasks.sql` to check if partitioning is needed
2. If recommended, schedule downtime and run `partition_orders_table.sql`
3. The partitioning script includes data migration and verification steps

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Run the maintenance script monthly to monitor growth and performance
2. **Partition Management**: If partitioning is implemented, create new monthly partitions proactively
3. **Index Monitoring**: Monitor index usage and add/remove indexes based on query patterns
4. **Autovacuum Tuning**: Adjust autovacuum settings based on actual table growth patterns

## Safety Notes

- ⚠️ The partitioning script requires application downtime
- ⚠️ Always backup your database before running maintenance scripts
- ⚠️ Test scripts in a development environment first
- ⚠️ The maintenance script is designed to be safe for production use

## Performance Benefits

- Improved query performance through better statistics
- Reduced table bloat through aggressive vacuuming
- Better query planning with NOT NULL constraints
- Faster large table queries with partitioning (when needed)
- Optimized indexes for common query patterns
