# File Analysis Checklist

## app/cart/page.tsx

### Issues Found:
1. **Duplicate "use client" directive** ✓
   - Line 1: `"use client"`
   - Line 3: `"use client";`
   - **Fix**: Remove one of the duplicate directives

2. **Import path issues** ✓
   - All imports appear to be valid based on file structure analysis
   - `@/context/AppContext` exists at `src/context/AppContext.tsx`
   - All other imports have corresponding files in the src directory

3. **Context usage** ✓
   - **Currently uses**: `useAppContext` from `@/context/AppContext`
   - **Should use**: Based on the layout structure, this appears correct as the AppProvider is in the root layout
   - **Issue**: The actual AppContext being used in layout.tsx is from `../src/contexts/AppContext` (note the 's' in contexts), but this file imports from `@/context/AppContext` (without 's')
   - **Potential mismatch**: The import path doesn't match the actual context provider in layout.tsx

## app/login/page.tsx

### Issues Found:
1. **Duplicate "use client" directive** ✓
   - Line 1: `"use client"`
   - Line 3: `"use client";`
   - **Fix**: Remove one of the duplicate directives

2. **Import path issues** ✓
   - All imports appear to be valid based on file structure analysis
   - `@/context/AppContext` exists at `src/context/AppContext.tsx`
   - All other imports have corresponding files in the src directory

3. **Context usage** ✓
   - **Currently uses**: `useAppContext` from `@/context/AppContext`
   - **Should use**: Based on the layout structure, this appears correct for login functionality
   - **Issue**: Same mismatch as cart page - imports from `@/context/AppContext` but layout uses `../src/contexts/AppContext`

## app/profile/page.tsx

### Issues Found:
1. **Duplicate "use client" directive** ✓
   - Line 1: `"use client"`
   - Line 3: `"use client";`
   - **Fix**: Remove one of the duplicate directives

2. **Import path issues** ✓
   - All imports appear to be valid based on file structure analysis
   - `@/context/UserContext` exists at `src/context/UserContext.tsx`
   - All other imports have corresponding files in the src directory

3. **Context usage** ✓
   - **Currently uses**: `useUserContext` from `@/context/UserContext`
   - **Should use**: This is correct for profile page as it needs user authentication data
   - **Issue**: Uses `toast` from 'sonner' library (line 16) instead of the project's toast system

## app/admin/page.tsx

### Issues Found:
1. **Duplicate "use client" directive** ✓
   - Line 1: `"use client"`
   - Line 3: `'use client';` (note: this one uses single quotes)
   - **Fix**: Remove one of the duplicate directives, standardize quotes

2. **Import path issues** ✓
   - All imports appear to be valid based on file structure analysis
   - All imports have corresponding files in the src directory

3. **Context usage** ✓
   - **Currently uses**: No context imports
   - **Should use**: Should probably use `UserContext` to check admin role/authentication
   - **Issue**: No authentication check for admin access

## Summary of Critical Issues:

1. **All four files** have duplicate "use client" directives
2. **Context path mismatch**: cart and login pages import from `@/context/AppContext` but the layout uses `../src/contexts/AppContext` (with 's')
3. **Profile page**: Uses 'sonner' toast instead of project's toast system
4. **Admin page**: No authentication/authorization context usage
5. **Mixed toast systems**: Profile page uses 'sonner', others use `@/hooks/use-toast`

## Recommended Context Usage by File:
- **cart/page.tsx**: Should use AppContext (for cart management)
- **login/page.tsx**: Should use AppContext (for login functionality)
- **profile/page.tsx**: Should use UserContext (for user profile data) ✓ Currently correct
- **admin/page.tsx**: Should use UserContext (for admin authentication check)
