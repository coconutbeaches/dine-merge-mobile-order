-- Migration: Guest Family Archiving
-- This migration creates the guest_family_archives table and updates customer functions
-- to support archiving guest families without mutating historical order data.

-- Create guest family archives table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.guest_family_archives (
  stay_id text PRIMARY KEY,
  archived_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE public.guest_family_archives ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create placeholder RLS policy
CREATE POLICY "guest_family_archives_policy" ON public.guest_family_archives
  FOR ALL USING (true);

-- Grant permissions to authenticated users
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, DELETE ON public.guest_family_archives TO authenticated;

-- Drop existing customer functions to recreate them with archiving support
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.get_customers_with_total_spent();
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.get_grouped_customers_with_total_spent();
